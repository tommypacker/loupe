# rankr
rankr is a tool that analyzes how accurate ESPN "Expert" rankings really are. It takes an expert's rankings each week 
and compares them with the actual scoring leaders from that week. Afterwards, it calculates the normalized root mean square
errors for each analyst for each position and displays the results on a grouped bar chart.

This project is currently a WIP - expect a better README soon
